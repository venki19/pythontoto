# Assume you want to build two functions for discounting products on a website.
# Function number 1 is for student discount which discounts the current price to 10%.
# Function number 2 is for additional discount for regular buyers which discounts an additional 5% on the current student discounted price.
# Depending on the situation, we want to be able to apply both the discounts on the products.
#
# Design the above two mentioned functions and apply them both simultaneously on the price.


def student_discount(price):
    price = price - (price * 10)/100
    return price


def additional_discount(newprice):

    return  newprice


selling_price = 100

# applying both discounts.
